# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat print-abi > stork.abi
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat deploy
npx hardhat upgrade --proxy-address 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512
```
