# Stork Cosmwasm Example

This directory contains two example contracts that consume Stork price updates. 

1. [Sylvia Example](sylvia) - A contract built with the Sylvia framework.
2. [Cosmwasm Core Example](cosmwasm_core) - A contract built with vanilla cosmwasm.

Both examples have the same interface, so you can use the same [CLI](../app) to interact with both contracts.
